# Eco Runner: Path To Sustainability

##### GAME OVERVIEW: 
* Eco Runner: Path To Sustainability is a 2D game where players control a character named Eco. Players must navigate Eco through a city/environment to collect sustainable items and avoid environmental hazards. The game promotes sustainable development and environmental awareness based on Sustainable Development Goals, particularly on the following: <br />

##### SDG/S INVOLVED : <br />
##### SDG 2: Zero Hunger <br /> 
* The game will encourage players to collect plant-based foods as sustainable items to replenish their health. This highlights the importance of zero hunger and the role that sustainable food production plays in creating a sustainable future. <br /> 

##### SDG 6: Good Health and Well-being <br />
* The game will encourage players to prioritize their health by avoiding harmful items and collecting sustainable ones. Players who successfully collect sustainable items and avoid harmful ones will more-likely hold much longer and raise their score.

##### SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation <br />
* The game will encourage players to avoid dirty water and prioritize collecting clean water and other sanitary sustainable items. By avoiding hazardous contents and collecting clean water, players can demonstrate the importance of clean and sustainable sanitation practices. <br /> <br />

##### GAMEPLAY: 
* The game will be played from a birds-eye or overhead perspective, where the player controls a character named Eco who runs through an environment. The player must avoid obstacles(Unsustainable Items) by sliding the screen and moving Eco left and right. As the game progresses, the speed increases and becomes more challenging. <br /> 

**The game will feature two types of items that the player can collect:**

* Sustainable Items - These items include plant-based foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables). Energy symbols, etc.

* Unsustainable Items - These items include pollution (e.g., smokestacks, garbage), wastes (e.g., plastic bottles, cups), and harmful products (e.g.,chemical cleaners).

By collecting sustainable items, the player will gain points accordingly, and the higher the points the better as there is a high score feature. Overall, Eco Runner: Path To Sustainability is engaging and can also be considered as an educational arcade game that encourages players to think about the importance of zero hunger, good health and well-being, and clean water and sanitation while being challenged.
